# Quant-stuff
A sample of Quant projects I have undertaken to better understand the field within my academic career and beyond. I find the field of 'finding alpha' fascinating and was delighted by the opportunity to study the subject within my Master's degree.  Sinking my teeth into the statistical black box of stochastic calculus was an invaluable learning opportunity that I felt greatly benefited my understanding and intuition of not just statistics but the world around me. While intellectually rigorous I find the topic of statistics to be fascinating, a combination of mathematics and chaos that touches on so many fields and aspects of our lives. The concept of the Brownian motion is one of those ideas that just clicked with me as a fundamental concept of the universe, an evolving process.
